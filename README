NAME
    CPAN::Perl::Releases - Mapping Perl releases on CPAN to the location of
    the tarballs

VERSION
    version 1.82

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Perl::Releases qw[perl_tarballs];

      my $perl = '5.14.0';

      my $hashref = perl_tarballs( $perl );

      print "Location: ", $_, "\n" for values %{ $hashref };

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Perl::Releases is a module that contains the mappings of all
    "perl" releases that have been uploaded to CPAN to the "authors/id/"
    path that the tarballs reside in.

    This is static data, but newer versions of this module will be made
    available as new releases of "perl" are uploaded to CPAN.

FUNCTIONS
    "perl_tarballs"
        Takes one parameter, a "perl" version to search for. Returns an
        hashref on success or "undef" otherwise.

        The returned hashref will have a key/value for each type of tarball.
        A key of "tar.gz" indicates the location of a gzipped tar file and
        "tar.bz2" of a bzip2'd tar file. The values will be the relative
        path under "authors/id/" on CPAN where the indicated tarball will be
        located.

          perl_tarballs( '5.14.0' );

          Returns a hashref like:

          {
            "tar.bz2" => "J/JE/JESSE/perl-5.14.0.tar.bz2",
            "tar.gz" => "J/JE/JESSE/perl-5.14.0.tar.gz"
          }

        Not all "perl" releases had "tar.bz2", but only a "tar.gz".

    "perl_versions"
        Returns the list of all the perl versions supported by the module in
        ascending order. "TRIAL" and "RC" will be lower than an actual
        release.

    "perl_pumpkins"
        Returns a sorted list of all PAUSE IDs of Perl pumpkins.
